information about this project:
Co-developed a fully custom autonomous submarine platform in collaboration with a PhD research team, covering mechanical design, embedded systems, and sensor integration.

Designed the full submarine chassis using 3D CAD modeling, including internal mounting rails, waterproof compartment layout, and sensor alignment geometry.

Selected, sourced, and interfaced multiple sensors (total 9 units) for environmental data acquisition and navigation tasks.

Implemented a distributed embedded architecture using three ESP32 microcontrollers, each handling three sensors, with synchronized data acquisition loops.

Developed a master–slave communication protocol between the main ESP32 (master) and the three sensor-handling ESP32 modules (slaves), using efficient serial or I²C communication for real-time data transfer.

Integrated machine learning pipelines for signal processing and environment recognition, including data preprocessing, model training, and embedded inference.

Conducted end-to-end testing: sensor calibration, noise reduction, communication latency analysis, waterproofing validation, and power-system stability testing.
